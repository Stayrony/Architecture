- `src` - Main projects (the product code)
- `tests` - Test projects
- `docs` - Documentation stuff, markdown files, help files etc.
- `samples` (optional) - Sample projects
- `lib` - Things that can **NEVER** exist in a nuget package
- `artifacts` - Build outputs go here. Doing a build.cmd/build.sh generates artifacts here (nupkgs, dlls, pdbs, etc.)
- `packages` - NuGet packages
- `build` - Build customizations (custom msbuild files/psake/fake/albacore/etc) scripts
- `build.cmd` - Bootstrap the build for windows
- `build.sh` - Bootstrap the build for *nix
- `global.json` - ASP.NET vNext only

There's probably more things that go in the ignore file.


- Update: Added docs folder
- Added README.md and LICENSE - Critical if you're OSS, if not ignore it
- Renamed `test` to `tests`
- Added lib for things that *CANNOT* exist in nuget packages
- Removed NuGet.config for people using packet :)
- Added global.json for ASP.NET vnext
- Added .editorconfig file in the root (x-plat IDE settings)
- Added NuGet.config back because people were confused about it missing
